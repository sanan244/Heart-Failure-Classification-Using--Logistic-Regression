# Heart-Failure-Classification
This project uses a simple Logistic Regression Model implemented via scikit-learn to classify heart failure(death event) based on 12 patient attributes. The dataset comes from UCI's dataset repository.(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
Highest Accuracy scores averaged around 80-85%. 
The dataset is relatively small, with a much larger dataset deep learning may be a good option to achieve higher accuracy.
